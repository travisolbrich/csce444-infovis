        <p>With information visualization as our goal, we decided to focus on how the Flickr community groups are
            connected by the many users across the website. In order to accomplish this, we are using a downsampled
            version of the Flickr Creative Community dataset curated and provided by Flickr.</p>

        <p> Using the provided Flick
            We have taken the provided data and broken it down over popular group names, the groups themselves, all the
            way down to the users making up the Flickr community. Due to the scope of this project, the represented
            groups make up the most popular groups within Flickr. Over the entire set of groups there are over 20,000
            connections between them all. We believe this effectively shows the vast web of interaction users experience
            as almost all groups have some connections.</p>
