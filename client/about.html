        <p>For information visualization as our goal, we decided to focus on how the Flickr community groups are connected by the many users across the website. In order to accomplish this, we are using a downsampled version of the Flickr Creative Community dataset curated and provided by Flickr.</p><p> We have taken the provided data and broken it down over popular group names, the groups themselves, all the way down to the users making up the Flickr community. Due to the scope of this project, the represented groups make up the most popular groups within Flickr. Over the entire set of groups there are over 20,000 connections between them all. We believe this effectively shows the vast web of interaction users experience as almost all groups have some connections.</p>
